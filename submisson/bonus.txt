### Bonus

All the resources related to the bonus are inside the `bonus` directory.

Under the bonus root you will find several sub-directories, each show different perspective of our cool error handling.
In addition you will find our ErrorHandling header that shows the elegant way we manage the errors.


All those travels should be ran with our algorithms (their .so are in the bonus directory).
If desired, it can be ran also with different so files and see their results

What makes our error handling special:
- It is very informative and well organized, and allows to debug problems very easily.
- Errors are numbered and documented properly, with respect do the requirements and their indices
- cool and formatted logging
- There is a special feature that allows see all the algorithms' return code error, for each call to the .so files.
It is a cool way to see (and for us to debug) how each algorithm reacted to each port/ship route/ship plan file.

### How to make all this beauty work?
- cd ./bonus_folder
- ./run_all_travels.sh

And that's it. the script will run everything for you. Just go inside the results folder and you'll be able to see
the cool behaviour in each category:

* fatal errors will not invoke the algorithm - and present the errors organized in an folder error
* specific_warning will show that the algorithm indeed return the expected code for SINGLE EACH BIT ERROR
* mixed warning will show how the algorithm collects all the errors and then reports them nicely.
* and finally, a valid travels to show that the algorithm can run on happy paths.

Hope that will do :)
