Or:
1) Implement checking if a container has wrong id
2) Count amount of operations per travel
3) Accredit Crane with actual ship operations
4) Add a shipPlan copy to class Algorithm

Together:
3* Write simulation result file
4* Read again very sourly the EX1 and Input/Output instructions and see we meet all the requirements
5* Add an abstract "Algorithm" class and set the naive algorithms to inherit from it
6* decouple the algorithm and the simulator


///////////////////// Things to verify/test

* For all files, a line starting with the # symbol should be considered as a comment line
  and be ignored.


* For all files, leading white spaces and any additional white spaces before or after
  comma shall be allowed and ignored.


* In case a position has an equal number of floors, or more, than the number of floors
provided in the first line, this input line shall be ignored and a proper warning message shall be printed to screen.

* If a given position exceeds the X/Y ship limits (as defined in the first line) it should be ignored
  and a proper warning message shall be printed to screen.


* If the file format cannot be read altogether, the file shall be ignored and a proper message
shall be printed to screen. Without a ship plan the simulation should ignore the travel
associated with this file.

* The same port may appear more than once, but not in two consecutive lines.

* Additional cargo_data files that were not in use (not in route or too many files for port) would
  be ignored but a proper warning message will be printed to screen.

* The last visit in the route is not expected to have a “Containers awaiting at port” file - ship is
  expected to unload only (and go for maintenance) at the last stop. In case last stop does
  have a “Containers awaiting at port” file, a proper warning should be printed to screen and
  the file shall be ignored.

* In case the number of “Containers awaiting at port” files for port P is less than the number of
  times P appears in the route file (not counting last stop, if this port is the last stop of the
  route): It shall be considered that in the last visits (==number of “missing files”) of the ship to
  port P, no cargo is to be loaded onto it, and cargo is only to be unloaded at destination P for
  those visits - if applicable. A proper warning should be printed to screen for a corresponding
  missing “Containers awaiting at port” file ( except for the last stop in the route which shall not
  have a file ).
