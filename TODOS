Or:
1) Implement checking if a container has wrong id
2) Count amount of operations per travel
3) Accredit Crane with actual ship operations
4) Add a shipPlan copy to class Algorithm
5) Create more travel input folders and expected output folder
6) write testers that verify the results (test also error handling!!)


Allen:

* What to in case of reject? is the algortihm is interactive

Together:
3* Write simulation result file
4* Read again very sourly the EX1 and Input/Output instructions and see we meet all the requirements
5* Add an abstract "Algorithm" class and set the naive algorithms to inherit from it
6* decouple the algorithm and the simulator
