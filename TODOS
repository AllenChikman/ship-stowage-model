Old debts:

1) Implement checking if a container has wrong id
2) Count amount of operations per travel and Write simulation result file
3) decouple the algorithm and the simulator


TODOs:

* Use C++ smart pointers to avoid or bring to minimum direct heap memory allocation and
deallocation - using std::make_unique and std::make_shared appropriately.

* implement one more naive algorithm, and make sure it hold with the same signature required
